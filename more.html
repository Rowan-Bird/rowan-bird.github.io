        <p>I make websites and point a camera at things and go click</p>

        <p>I'm from Ontario, Canada. Over time I've made a lot of internet stuff, I started learning HTML when I was 9 with an old book about JavaScript that I found in my room. My first ever website no longer exists. The first website I made that was actually on the internet still exists however, I made it when I was around 11 or 12. It can be found <a href="http://birdonline.125mb.com/indexold.html">here</a>, yes, the search bar is fake :).</p>
        <p>Over time my equipment has evolved too, for me it all started with an HP Pavilion DV2402ca, just like the one below</p>
